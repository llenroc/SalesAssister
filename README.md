## Sales Assiter

This is a free online CRM tool, built in the .NET framework with Visual Studio. 

## This project uses...

  - C#
  - CSHTML
  - .NET 
  - AJAX
  - JQuery
  - Javascript

  - Microsoft SQL server.
 
## Setup Instructions

Clone this project to your machine in Visual Studio. Copy the MyData.sql file and create the database for the project in Microsoft SQL Server.

## Project description

Once you have successfully setup the database you can run the program from "web" option in Visual Studio. Once the project builds you can access it at http://localhost:5000. By clicking the green "Register" button the user will be able to register for a free account and start keeping track of all of their clients, interactions with those clients and send them text message reminders for appointments. 

I have also included a login option for LinkedIn, allowing the user to access LinkedIn from the Sales Assister site.
